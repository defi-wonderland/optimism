# supertoken properties

legend:

- `[ ]`: property not yet tested
- `**[ ]**`: property not yet tested, dev/research team has asked for extra focus on it
- `[X]`: tested/proven property
- `[~]`: partially tested/proven property
- `:(`: property won't be tested due to some limitation

| 0   | supertoken token address does not depend on the executing chain’s chainID          | [ ]    | [ ]    |
| 1   | supertoken token address depends on name, remote token, address and decimals       | [ ]    | [ ]    |
| 2   | convert() should only allow converting legacy tokens to supertoken and viceversa   | [ ]    | [ ]    |
| 3   | convert() only allows migrations between tokens representing the same remote asset | [ ]    | [ ]    |
| 4   | convert() only allows migrations from tokens with the same decimals                | [ ]    | [ ]    |
| 5   | convert() burns the same amount of one token that it mints of the other            | [ ]    | [ ]    |

## Atomic bridging pseudo-properties

As another layer of defense, the following properties are defined which assume bridging operations to be atomic (that is, the sequencer and L2Inbox and CrossDomainMessenger contracts are fully abstracted away, `sendERC20` triggering the `relayERC20` call on the same transaction)
It’s worth noting that these properties will not hold for a live system

# Expected external interactions

- regular ERC20 operations between any accounts on the same chain, provided by [crytic ERC20 properties](https://github.com/crytic/properties?tab=readme-ov-file#erc20-tests)

# Invariant-breaking candidates (brain dump)

here we’ll list possible interactions that we intend the fuzzing campaign to support in order to help break invariants

- [ ] changing the decimals of tokens after deployment
- [ ] `convert()` ing between multiple (3+) representations of the same remote token, by having different names/symbols
